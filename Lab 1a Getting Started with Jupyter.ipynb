    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Physics 202 Lab! Our primary learning goals for you in this lab are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Give you hands-on experimental experience with the phenomena of thermal and quantum physics you'll be studying in class \n",
    "* Develop and refine your skills as an experimental physicist\n",
    "\n",
    "In your previous labs in PHYS 107 & 108, you've probably had some experience with designing experiments, building apparatus, and communicating your results. But another very important thing experimental physicists need to be able to do is to *construct mathematical models of experimental setups or physical phenomena* and *fit mathematical models to data.* Learning and practicing this skill will be a major emphasis of our first few labs this semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting models to data is almost always a task for a computer -- in virtually all cases, the necessary calculations are simply too tedious to do by hand. You may have previously done linear fits with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. Here, we will introduce some Python tools that can perform linear fits as well as fits of more complicated functions. We will also introduce an environment, the Jupyter notebook, that is excellent for organizing and presenting analyses of scientific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have had some experience with Python simulations in PHYS 107 & 108 or with Python programming in a computer science class. But don't worry if you haven't -- your instructors and classmates are here to help, and we hope you'll find that the Python software ecosystem is easy-to-learn and user-friendly."

    "## Installing a scientific Python distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general-purpose programming language, Python itself has few useful built-in tools for visualizing and analyzing data. However, the standard scientific packages for Python including [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://scipy.org/), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) provide a very powerful suite of tools that have recently found widespread use in physics, astronomy, quantitative biology, data science, and many other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the easiest way to get up and running with scientific Python and all the tools you need is to install a *distribution*. We strongly recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is free and open source. Note that you will need to download Anaconda even if you've previously had Python or VPython set up on your computer. Of course, if you've already installed Anaconda for some other purpose, you can ignore what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from which you can download Anaconda.\n",
    "2. Select the operating system your computer has -- Anaconda is available for both Windows (32 and 64 bit), OS X, and Linux.\n",
    "3. You'll need to select a Python version, either 2.7 or 3.5. If you've never installed Python before, we suggest 3.5 as it is the future of the language. While there are some differences between Python 3.5 and 2.7, they will not affect what we do in this course. If you already have 2.7 set up, that will work.\n",
    "4. Download the installer (it might take a few minutes) and follow the instructions.\n",

    "As a practicing physicist, it will frequently be convenient to combine data, computations on those data, visual results from those computations (especially graphs), as well as explanatory text. Jupyter notebooks provide a [complete and self-contained record](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) of the computations and analysis you'll do in lab that is moreover easy to share. (This document is in fact generated from a Jupyter notebook, which you are encouraged to download and explore).\n",

The default directory you will see on the dashboard is the one from which you launched Jupyter (most likely, your home directory.) It is probably a good idea to create a new directory on your hard drive for your lab work. You can do this via your operating system, or via the \"New\" button on the dashboard.\n",
